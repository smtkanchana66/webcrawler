# Simple Python Web Crawler

This project is a basic web crawler implemented in Python.
It fetches web pages using the urllib library, extracts URLs using BeautifulSoup and regular expressions, and stores all discovered links in a text file.

The crawler is designed for learning purposes, demonstrating multiple approaches to HTML parsing:
- Regular expressions (legacy / experimental)
- BeautifulSoup (current active implementation)
- No external crawling frameworks are used.
